# CODE_for_Cochleogram-based_Adventitious_Sounds_Classification_using_Convolutional_Neural_Networks

# In order to be able to run this code, several folders are needed:
# -Graphs: a folder that will store the figures for the CNN models in each experiment
# -MODELS: a folder that will store the models and weights generated in each experiment
# -RESULTS: a folder that will store .npz files with the results generated in each experiment
